	Note: All values are steps unless otherwise indicated.

	Bugs: Currently if there is a single value at the end of a row in the bitmap
	the function will not actually engrave that spot. This may be not a big problem
	since we have decent resolution.

	G-codes/GRBL Commands:
	$H - runs the homing routine
	G0 - Rapid linear motion
	G1 - Linear Motion
		Linear motion example: G0/G1 X1.2 Y2.1 Z3 E4
		XYZ in mm, E is gimbal stepper position in steps (*** need to set this in firmware)
	G2 - Clockwise arc
	G3 - Counter-clockwise arc
	G17 - sets it so arc moves (G2,G3) move on the XY plane
	G90.1 - sets it to absolute distance mode. Arc moves I,J must be specified (x,y offsets from 0 position of axis)
	G91.1 - sets it to relative distance mode. Arc moves I,J must be specified (x,y offsets from current position of axis)
	S* - Sets the laser power level where * = 0-255 (0 is off) (***need to confirm this is the correct range for grbl) 
	M4 puts the engraver in dynamic laser power mode (auto turn laser on to S* power level when moving(G1-3))

/*
Executing a jog requires a specific command structure, as described below:

The first three characters must be '$J=' to indicate the jog.

The jog command follows immediate after the '=' and works like a normal G1 command.

Feed rate is only interpreted in G94 units per minute. A prior G93 state is ignored during jog.

Required words:

XYZ: One or more axis words with target value.
F - Feed rate value. NOTE: Each jog requires this value and is not treated as modal.
Optional words: Jog executes based on current G20/G21 and G90/G91 g-code parser state. If one of the following optional words is passed, that state is overridden for one command only.

G20 or G21 - Inch and millimeter mode
G90 or G91 - Absolute and incremental distances
G53 - Move in machine coordinates

0x85 : Jog Cancel
